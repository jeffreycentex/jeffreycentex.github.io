Welcome to my Fresh Beginnings!

Out with the old and in with the new?  Is that still pertinent in todays age?  Yes.  Much of my old content is, let's just say, **old**.  So time to start fresh.  Content here will cover healthcare informatics topics, Veradigm solutions, HIPAA, Privacy, Security, and anything else that is interesting to me.  Or whatever you want me to talk about (cast a line to me, I may be game).

I'm keeping the old content available in a github repository (the last content was Hugo, so it is all Markdown) if you really, really, really want to look at it.  Since I am a data hoarder, I loathe to actually get rid of data (and stuff, too).  This data is available [here](https://jeffreycentex.gitlab.io)

I'm also going to continue on my Autism posts for people in the tech field.  Yes, I know there are a lot of us.  Yes, we are all different.  But I want to offer my help to anyone so you don't have to struggle like I did when growing up, getting a job, and attempting to live in a real world that is much different than non-neurodivergents understand.

Also some hiking and backpacking pictures and commentary.  I want to do more of this in the next few months.

Enough with the dilly-dallying.  On with the show.
