Just a quick post.  The past four weeks have been busy.  As some of you know, I am an Instructional Associate at Georgia Institute of Technology for the OMSCY CS 6250 Computer Networking course.  Basically, I am a project instructor responsible for handling two of the projects - Simulating Networks (aka Introduction to Mininet) and SDN Firewall (Openflow with POX OpenFlow Controller) as well as some administrative stuff like watching exam videos, doing class videos, and building the Virtual Machines for all architectures (this bit me in the butt last Fall due to a LXQT and Ubuntu bug that I definitely do not wish to remember or deal with again).  Well, the SDN Firewall project was assigned about the time of my last post.  It was finished two weeks ago and I ran the parallel autograder for a week and finished manual grading last Saturday and posted scores later that day.  This is one of my extremely busy times of the year because of the project, chat sessions, grading, office hours, and everything else.  So I have been absent due to that.

I will also be celebrating my birthday in the next few days and will start off the celebration playing a bit of Ultimate Werewold and Blood on the Clocktower on Friday night, going to the Sherwood Ren Fest on Saturday morning (sad emoji for not being a friend of faire this year), and then some work at church on Sunday morning.  No eclipse watch for me, though I might (remotely) take part in some of the propogation tests being run in the amateur radio side of things.

I really want to go backpacking and hiking, but I feel too crappy to do it right now.  Allergies.  Depression.  What a combo that is a double whammy.  Just need to get out and do it, I guess.  Future plans include going to Belton in a couple of weeks for the hamfest, and I need to make a pilgrammage to MicroCenter to pickup the replacement Bambu Labs A1 bed for the 3D-printer I gave to Celena (I love my Bambu P1S).

Now a question, though I don't know of anyone local who will read any of my posts.  I want to set up a Meshtastic network in New Braunfels.  I'm going to put a solar power internet connected node with a gain antenna, but for it to get anywhere, I need other people with nodes.  It's cheap, but it is a bit hacky.  If anyone locally (hell, anyone anywhere) is interested, send me an email.  You don't need to be a Ham or anything.  If you have heard of a GoTenna, it is similar in practice.  If you go to a festival (I plan to do a few this year), they are awesome to keep up with your friends when the cell environment is overloaded (or unavailable) since you can use the mesh device to communicate with each other.

That's it for today.  Have a great week.
