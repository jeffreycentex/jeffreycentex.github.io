### Who am I?

Hey.  My name is Jeff Randow.  I'm an engineer and scientist by education, and an explorer and solver at heart.  If you want to get the boring stuff out of the way, you can check out my C.V. and see my education, work, blah, blah, and blah.  I'm boring, but I try not to be.  I have a dry sense of humor, but I'm getting better at it.  I have high functioning autism which has affected me most of my life, but I have learned to adapt around it.  I love the outdoors and like to walk, run (well, jog or walk quickly), hike, bike, and backpack.  I'm not a party animal, but I do like music.  I pretty much like any type of music.  I enjoy watching football and baseball.  I love playing Nerf Foam Wars (and Humans vs Zombies), bowling, than pickleball.  I suck at all these things, but I still enjoy doing them.  I like simulation games on the computer and social deception games + DnD in real life.

I'm a hacker, but not like a classical computer hacker.  I can do that stuff, too, but I like to experiment.  I do 3D-printing, drone piloting, mesh networks (Meshtastic which is kinda like GoTenna, and AREDN which is ham-wifi at much higher power), shortwave listening (I have a KiwiSDR that you can listen to), plane tracking, building nodes with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos.  I have electrical engineering knowledge, but I'm actually an environmental engineer.

Yeah, all those contradictions.  That's me.

### How to contact me?

Easiest way is email:  jeffrey -at- jeffreyrandow -dot- org  (You know what to do)

My Public Key for that email is available [here](/assets/keys/publickey.jeffrey@jeffreyrandow.org-fc2ebb8d3d0cbb246ea685d366f349357da2564e.asc).

I accept encrypted email.

If you must, you can send SMS/RCS to my cell phone number on my resume, but I prefer Signal or Threema.

### Encryption

My signing public GPG Keey is available as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/jeffreycentex/5a5d3ab3116c9cb8ad9598dc63fb0c02).  This is different than the email address above.  

I also have a keybase proof as a GitHub Gist

### Social Media

I'm on all the usual social media, though I primarily only use Facebook and Discord.  I'm slowly figuring out the Fediverse and am starting to use Mastodon.
