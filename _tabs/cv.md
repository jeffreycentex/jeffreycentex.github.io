Thank you for visiting my C.V. / Resume webpage.  I'm not actively seeking new employment, but I am open to hearing about opportunities that can mutually benefit both me and your organization.  I would prefer remote work (if available), otherwise I am limited to opportunities in the Central Texas area (Austin/San Antonio corridor).  In the not-so-near future, I may be open to opportunities in the Pacific Northwest and North Carolina/Kentucky/Tennessee/Arkansas.

## ABOUT
I work in a healthcare environment providing the practice with clinical and financial data from our Electronic Health Records and Patient Management system using Python, Flask, Transact-SQL (MS SQL Server), Veradigm Unity API, HL7 interfaces, and FHIR. I also manage security for our EDR/XDR solution, build solutions on Azure for remote access, and identity protection. I come from an engineering background, so I have extensive problem solving skills. I am seeking to find employment in a healthcare environment that can utilize my skills.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Panoramic Health / San Antonio Kidney, San Antonio, TX**  
May 2013 – Present  
Healthcare IT and Developer

My day-to-day activities involve running back-end reports for our clinical, accounting, and billing sections of the practice (and automating them into a self-service portal), researching data in our EHR and Patient Management systems, monitoring the security of our network and infrastructure, and other Healthcare IT activities as needed.

##### Highlights
I created an export system that took daily activities (clinical, billing, claims, financial, and administration) from our EHR and Patient Management system and uploaded it to the Data Warehouse that our practice was a member of. This system includes using Python, Pandas, Transact-SQL, XLSXWriter, and other tools. This script has run on a daily basis for the past 8 years with modifications made upon each major version upgrade to our EHR and PM system.

I created HL7 interfaces into EHR/PM to interop with laboratories, hospitals, insurance companies, and others as required. I also created the necessary XML Transforms to successfully format the data to be imported into the EHR System.

I built a clinical portal system to help staff manage patients who need to use a drug that will raise their Hemoglobin levels. This system looks into EHR data, charts history, shows lab levels, displays insurance eligibility, warns of old clinical lab data, and provides a summary for the patient. This utilizes data from both the EHR system as well as the Patient Management system built with Python and Flask.

Instructional Associate (IA)

Past Position: Graduate Teaching Assistant An Instructional Associate is a faculty-level position in helping to teach one of the online Graduate program classes as a part of the Online Masters in Computer Science Program offered by Georgia Tech. While I was a student, I was a Graduate Teaching Assistant, but I continued on after graduation as an Instructional Associate. I have had this position for two classes - CS 6250 Computer Networks and CS 8200 Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems.

##### Highlights

I manage the SDN Firewall project for the Computer Networking class. This has included revamping the project multiple times due to Python version changes, Openflow Controller changes, and instructional demands. I migrated the project from the Pyretic controller to the POX controller. I run chat sessions, office hours, and grade and followup academic integrity issues for this project since January 2016.

I also maintain and support the Simulating Networks project which introduces students to Mininet.
